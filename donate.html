			<h2>IT COSTS ABOUT $2,000 TO SUPPORT A FATHER THROUGH THE ENTIRE SIX MONTH PROGRAM.</h2>

			<p>Philanthropy directly influences program services, awareness and advocacy.  Provision of much-needed services is fueled by philanthropic gifts and bridges the gap between delivery costs and discernable positive impacts for sincere, yet, struggling fathers.  Please consider making a gift to one of the Center's Strategic Initiatives or a Local Fatherhood Program.</p>

			<h2>IMPACT</h2>

			<img src="img/program_feature_hispanic.jpg" alt="father with child" />

			<h3>Savings</h3>
			<p>Father to Father Project has served 246 court-ordered fathers since 2006.  These fathers, on average, would have cost the state more than $1.8 million if incarcerated for six months, the average non-payment sentence.  Instead, they completed the fatherhood program, paid $286,785 in child support and arrears and spent time with their children - better results at a fraction of the cost.</p>

			<h3>Stats</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>From 2003 - 2010, our program has helped 1,209 men step up to being responsible fathers with the potential to affect 2,816 children.</li>
				<li>Of the 490 unemployed fathers, 300 gained employment.</li>
				<li>In total, 744 of the fathers were employed. 114 got a better paying job or increased earnings in their existing job.</li>
				<li>625 received job readiness education and job skills training.</li>
				<li>The program provided transportation to 173 fathers.</li>
				<li>596 fathers reported a somewhat hostile to no relation with the other parent, 292 improved their other-parent relationship.</li>
				<li>819 received parenting education.</li>
				<li>694 fathers reported not seeing their child at all or only a few times per year.</li>
				<li>Overall, 471 of the participating fathers reported increased contact with their child.</li>

				<p>Let's face it. Fathers impact children's lives - for good and sadly sometimes for bad.  The Center strives to ensure that fathers make a long lasting, positive impact in the lives of their children.  However, we can not do it alone. Your financial support enables continuation of services.  Every dollar helps to support more than 1200 fathers served annually through strategic initiatives at the Center and six local fatherhood programs in eleven sites.  We provide numerous services under one roof so that fathers don't waste time traveling from agency to agency.  All services are focused on guiding fathers toward resources and information which will enable them to provide for their children financially, emotionally and spiritually increasing the potential for them to grow into responsible adults.  Your gift at any level will make a difference in the lives of fathers, and, equally important, in the lives of children.</p>

				<h3>In-Kind Donations</h3>
				<div class="inkind_left">
				<p>We also welcome in-kind donations! Did you know that donations as simple as a box of staples or children’s books can go a long way? Like any business, office supplies constitute a necessary expense, but with your help we can keep this expense to a minimum and ensure that even more of our funds go towards program services. We also accept other simple donations for our low income fathers such as clothes, toys, and used or old technology. Browse our wish list below and feel free to make an in-kind donation of one or more of the items on the list. All donations large and small will be appreciated. </p>

				<p>Please check with us before making a donation since some items are needed more than others at different times. For more information, contact please contact the North Charleston office at 843-744-2126.</p>
